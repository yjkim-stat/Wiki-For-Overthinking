## Abstract

Beam-search-based test-time methods provide an effective way to improve large language model (LLM) performance on long-horizon generation by pruning invalid reasoning paths early, leading to significantly improved reasoning efficiency and more favorable test-time cost scaling. Despite strong empirical success, the theoretical understanding of beam search remains limited. In this paper, we study the test-time compute guarantee of the commonly used beam search framework that uses the model's internal log-likelihood for intermediate scoring, while relying on an external reward model only after a complete response is generated. We first establish a lower bound for vanilla beam search, showing that at least $\Omega(C^\star(x)^2)$ samples are required for the optimal response to survive, where $C^\star(x)$ is the token-level coverage coefficient for prompt $x$. This motivates our modified confidence-filtered beam search (CF-Beam), which reduces the sufficient coverage dependence from quadratic to nearly linear under prefix competitiveness, for fixed horizon, gap, and target accuracy. We then show that the regret of CF-Beam is upper-bounded by the probability of rare failure events and the reward estimation error scaled by a path-level coverage coefficient, where the rare-failure term vanishes as per-step sampling increases. Our results highlight a fundamental advantage of beam search over sequence-level inference methods such as Best-of-N and Best-of-Majority. While the guarantees of these approaches typically involve coverage coefficients that grow exponentially with the horizon $L$, CF-Beam controls the dominant search-induced term through a token-level coverage coefficient that scales polynomially with $L$. Our numerical experiments further confirm that beam search is more robust on hard instances and under increasing reasoning horizons.
