- [Beyond Reasoning Gains: Mitigating General-Capability Forgetting in Large Reasoning Models](../../archive/papers/2026/doi-10-18653-v1-2026-findings-acl-1717/summary.md) — RECAP mitigates the general-capability forgetting (perception, grounding, safety) that RLVR-based reasoning fine-tuning causes in vision-language models, by replaying general-domain data alongside the reasoning objective and dynamically reweighting each objective's loss based on its recent convergence rate and instability -- an entropy-regularized priority allocation that provably reduces to a closed-form softmax -- preserving or improving general capabilities while matching or exceeding reasoning-only fine-tuning's math/reasoning performance, and, as a side effect, producing shorter, more concise reasoning rationales without compromising reasoning ability.
- [Addressing Overthinking in Large Vision-Language Models via Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization](../../archive/papers/2026/doi-10-18653-v1-2026-findings-acl-215/summary.md) — GPRO diagnoses that visual perception failures (not reasoning errors) cause over twice as many incorrect predictions across model scales in vision-language models, then routes each generated token through one of three paths -- a fast FFN, a slow cross-attention perception path for re-examining the image, or a slow self-reflection reasoning path -- via a lightweight meta-reasoning controller trained with PPO on a multi-objective reward (task accuracy, path-cost penalty, and an uncertainty-calibration term derived from ~790K GPT-4-labeled perception-vs-reasoning failure attributions); GPRO-7B matches/beats far larger closed models and long-CoT distillation baselines while cutting response length up to 51.5%, activating slow paths sparsely (73% Fast/17% Perception/10% Reasoning) and correctly, targeting perception re-examination at high-frequency visual tokens and reasoning refinement at logical connectives.
