## Appears in

- [Cognitive Profiling of LRMs' Reasoning Traces Using Bloom's Taxonomy](../../archive/papers/2026/arxiv-2608-23205/summary.md) — The paper segments LRM reasoning traces into cognitive steps with Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, labels each step with one of Bloom's six levels, and uses the resulting level proportions and 6x6 transition matrix to profile seven reasoning models and to predict solution correctness.
- [CoTJudger: A Graph-Driven Framework for Automatic Evaluation of Chain-of-Thought Efficiency and Redundancy in LRMs](../../archive/papers/2026/doi-10-18653-v1-2026-findings-acl-2077/summary.md) — CoTJudger converts free-form CoTs into directed dependency graphs (capturing backtracking, repetition, and self-correction via classified node/edge types) and extracts the Shortest Effective Path (SEP) -- the minimal, verified-sufficient reasoning skeleton -- to compute a scale-invariant Redundancy Ratio; across 21 LRMs it finds redundancy pervasive but structurally distinct by model family (DeepSeek-R1's high-in-degree 'Cyclic Complexity' looping vs. Qwen3-Max's high-uncertainty 'Semantic Verbosity' vs. Gemini-3-Pro's low-degree 'Local Over-Optimization'), that distilled models inherit and often amplify their teacher's redundancy (a 'reasoning illusion' where distillation transfers verbosity without the underlying verification capability), and that post-answer redundancy specifically includes 'Destructive Revision' where a correct answer is unstably discarded for a wrong one.
